Java

When multiple threads try to access a common resource, then there is 
possibility of inconsistency. To avoid this inconsistency we use synchronization

When threads are synchronized and a thread one accesses a resource,
the java would put and intrinsic lock or monitor lock, so that no other thread can access the resource

Three types of synchronization:
1. Method level - methods are marked synchronized. A monitor lock is kept on that method when it runs. No other synchronized method can access that resource now
2. Object level - Code Block synchronization. That means it is not based on class level. 
3. Class level - Static element synchronization.
